# Prework - *Random Background Generator*

Submitted by: **Rogelio Lozano**

**Random Background Generator** is an app that...
  says a little bit about me. My name is Rogelio Lozano, I go to the University of Illinois at Chicago, 
  and I aspire to become a Swift Instructor some day. Along with this information about me, the app will
  generate a new background color each time that the button "New Background Color" is pressed.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

 Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps

    1. Reddit
      - I like that there are communities for most topics you could think of. It is mainly this concept of communities that I like.
      - I like that there is a like and dislike feature, allowing the voice of the community to be heard, giving a strong communitarian feel.
      
    2. Pinterest
      - I like the grid view, allowing you to scroll through and stop to see what you like. It's almost like a museum in that sense.
      - Suggesting similar images to what you have seen. This feature is hard to explain, but when you click on an image, you can scroll
        down to see images that are closely related to the one you selected, but if you swipe right or left, you can see images that have 
        more difference, potentially showing new images.
        
    3. Instagram
      - Easy messaging between friends. This feature would be the Direct Messages feature, allowing you to communicate with other
      - Stories feature, allowing you to stay caught up with your friends and family lives

  My App Concept

    I like pinterest for it's artistic and inspirational value. I like reddit for it's sense of community, where everyone can speak their mind on such diverse topics.
    I like Instagram because it allows you to socialize with your friends and family in a fun way. I would like to make an app the combines some of these great
    qualities, but hopefully can focus in on a particular task without confusing users. 
    
    Maybe my app could be similar to having a grid view of images, then onces you click on an image, it will have a comments section where people can converse. 
    Pinterest already has a comments section, but people rarely use it. I would like to make my app a form of pinterest that brings more community into conversation.
    Along with this, I would like to add a direct messages concept to my app, allowing people to share images and videos with each other that they find, similar to Instagram.

## Notes

  Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  
    I did not encounter much challenges thanks to the good directions in the prework, but I the XCode IDE can be quite confusing
    and there are a lot of tools available to use. It will take a lot of learning to be able to use Xcode to it's full potential.
